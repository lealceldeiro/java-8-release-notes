## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you
might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please
[include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in
[the template](https://github.com/lealceldeiro/gms/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Perform a [search](https://github.com/lealceldeiro/java-release-notes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=)** to see if the enhancement has
already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the
following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**.

### Pull Requests

The process described here aims to:

* Maintain Java Release Notes up to date with the state of the art of the Java ecosystem.

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in
[the template](https://github.com/lealceldeiro/java-release-notes/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md).
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides).

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask
you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Start the commit messages with the issue number (if apply) and a short description of what is this commit about.
* Use the present tense ("Add description of Java 8 feature" not "Added description of Java 8 feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Expand explanation on..." not "Expands explanation on...").
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) whenever possible.
